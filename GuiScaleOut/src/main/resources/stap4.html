<p><u><b>Optimizations:</b></u></p>
<p>It is clear that in order to make the program faster, you need to find a way
to reduce the number of calculations you are going to make. If you use <b>Brute Force</b> there
seem to be over 60 milion possibilities to place the blocks on the grid. </p>
<p>
<u><b>First optimization ... Whitespace counting:</b></u><br></p>
<p>
One of the interesting observations to be made is that every block you place on the grid will cover 5 cells 
of the grid. That means that if you count the number of free consecutive blocks, it must be able to be divided by 5. 
If this is not the case, it will never fit all the blocks. Implementing this can save you a lot of calculations on a grid
that will never have a solution.</p>
<p>
<b>This is the optimization that Jan Sipke explained on his website and implemented in his code.</b>
<br><br>Hereby I would like to thank Jan Sipke for his information on the web.
