This Program was written in 2001, the year I went to Java One and accepted the Dutch JUG challenge to create a program in 5 days that calculates all possible solutions to the <b>Yasumi</b> puzzle.<br/>

The ones who tried this beform me know that writing this program could be faster than actually executing it.<br/>Due to the numerous possibilities of placing the building blocks, a <b>brute force</b>
 program would take longer than one hour to come to a result.
<br/>
After some thinking and programming I came with this program and during the load, you will get an introduction on how this program is operating. 
<br/>
The time to load all the possible solutions that this program is capable of finding will be <b>under 2 Minutes</b> where the elapsed time back then was around 15 minutes.
<br/>
In any case I want to thank you for your attention,
<br/><br/>
