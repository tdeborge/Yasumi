<table>
<tr>
<td><font size="6">It is very important to notice that the cross piece in the
 puzzle is a very unique one. In whatever direction you mirror this piece
 or rotate, it will always be the same shape. That means that we have a piece 
 that we can use as a reference in our grid. You do not have to worry about
 multiple possibilities and start rotating and mirroring the pieces.</font></td>

</tr>
</table>
<p>
<font size="6"><u><b>Third optimization ... No piece is the same:</b></u><br><br>
Another remark is that no pice is identical. That means that when finding a solution, 
the mirrored images are also a different solution. That makes that 1 solution contains 3 more.<br><br>
<u><b>Fourth optimization ... Minimize it all:</b></u></font></p>
<p>
<font size="6">When combining the theory with the cross and the the uniqueness of the pieces, I thought that the best
way to run this program is trying the Cross in every possible place of the first quadrant of the grid
with all other blocks attached. The cross needs to be placed without falling in a mirrored position. 
Then every solution is 4 in reality.</font></p>
