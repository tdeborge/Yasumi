<p><u><b>Program Build-Up</b></u></p>
<p>
Due to timepressure in my first release, I was calculating a wrong number of solutions. After some debugging I found that the
reason for this was a wrong 'block' definition in the properties file. Due to that reason, a certain block could never be placed
in the bottom row of the grid.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion is that I was able to build a Java program that calculated all solution under 20 minutes compared to the C solution that ran for 80 hours 
due to the leap in technology.
