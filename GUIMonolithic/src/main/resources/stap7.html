<font size="6"><u><b>The program classes</b></u><br><br>
<p><b><u>Block.class</b></u></p>
<p>
The Block class holds the information about the block. Therefor it contains all possible shapes of the block.
It is also capable of printing itself and it knows if it is used on the Grid.</p>
<p>
<b><u>BlockContainer.class</u></b></p>
<p>
The BlockContainer class is like the toybox for kids. It contains all the blocks and is used as a reference container.<br><br>
<b><u>Grid.class</u></b></p>
<p>
The Grid class is able to place blocks, calculate if they are good or not and print out the grid. It also 
has mirroring capabilities to find the different solutions.</p>
<p>
<b><u>Puzzler.class</u></b>
<p>
The Puzzler class is the person taking the BlockContainer and starts to try to put the blocks on the Grid.
The solutions are stored in an ArrayList and saved on disk at the end. The option is open to load the saved file instead of recalculating the complete
list again.</p>
