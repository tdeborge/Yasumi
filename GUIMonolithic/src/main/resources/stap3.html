<p><u><b>How to start:</b></u></p>
<p>
The first thing to think about is how do I start to get to a solution. The answer is easy: 
</p>
<p>
<b><center>'what can we find on the Internet?'.</center></b></p>
<p>
After some time spend on the internet, it is clear that there is not enough information. In the end 
I got 1 interesting site at http://www.connectionlab.com/blocks/index.html.
</p>
<p>It seems that the author of the page <b>Jan Sipke van der Veen</b> had spent some time on the game.
I contacted this person as he was willing to share a program that calculated the results. After explaining the 
reason why I was interested, I could take a peek at his code. </p>
<p>
This program ran for 80 minutes on his Pentium II 366 MHz.</p>
<p>The program of Jan Sipke had one optimization but it is clear that other are possible.</p>
